## Project Overview

This portfolio project was created to refine my skills in frontend development and design. Using **React + Vite** for structure and **Tailwind CSS** for rapid styling, I focused on building a responsive, user-friendly, and visually appealing interface. The design of the portfolio is inspired by a tweet [here](https://x.com/ItsRuthjebet/status/1852039493953446032) that motivated me to enhance my ability to combine aesthetic design with functionality.
